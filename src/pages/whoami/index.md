A Cyber Security specialist and a privacy enthusiast.<!-- end --> 

I've always been in the habit of creating personal notes and I decided to start sharing them in hopes of:

1.  Providing <i>potentially</i> useful techniques that may assist others during penetration tests/red team engagements
2.  Presenting & explaining my security research
3.  Explaining complex concepts in a simplified and causal way

There may be mistakes or better ways of doing things so if you have any comments or suggestions feel free to DM me on twitter.
