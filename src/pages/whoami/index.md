A Cyber Security specialist and a privacy enthusiast.<!-- end --> 

I've always been in the habit of creating personal notes and I decided to start sharing them in hopes of:

1.  Providing <i>potentially</i> useful techniques that may assist others during penetration tests/red team engagements
2.  Explaining complex concepts in a simplified and causal way
3.  Presenting my perspective on how I think through problems (might not always be the right or efficient way)
4.  Documenting techniques so I can refer back to them in the future

There may be mistakes or better ways of doing things so if you have any comments or suggestions feel free to DM me on twitter.
