A Cyber Security specialist and a privacy enthusiast.<!-- end --> 

I created this blog to serve the following purposes:

1.  Sharing <i>potentially</i> useful techniques that can help others during penetration tests, red team engagements or general knowledge
2.  Giving my perspective on how I think through problems (might not be the right or efficient way)
3.  Documenting techniques so I can refer back to them in the future

There may be mistakes or a better way of doing things so if you have any comments or suggestions feel free to DM me on twitter.
