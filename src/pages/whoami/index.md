My name is mr.d0x and I'm a Cyber Security Specialist and a privacy enthusiast.<!-- end --> 

I created this blog to serve the following purposes:

1.  Documenting <i>potentially</i> useful methods that can help others during penetration testing/red team engagements
2.  Give my perspective on how I think through problems (doesn't mean it's the right way)
3.  Inspire others 

There may be mistakes in some of the things I write or a better way of doing things.
If you'd like to recommend topics for the blog or just chat feel free to DM me on twitter <b>@mrd0x</b>.
